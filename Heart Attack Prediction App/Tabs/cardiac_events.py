    Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a **dysautonomic disorder** affecting the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which controls involuntary functions like **heart rate, blood pressure, and circulation**.  
    The defining feature of POTS is an **abnormal heart rate increase of ‚â•30 bpm upon standing (or ‚â•40 bpm in teens)** without a significant blood pressure drop.

    While POTS is not a heart disease, it can **mimic cardiac conditions** like heart attacks, making accurate diagnosis essential. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is not a form of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but rather a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can cause heart rate to increase excessively upon standing.
